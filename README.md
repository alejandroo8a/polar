It's an android application for sales products, save the data locally and finally when the app go to online mode and make a backup. This use SQLite like database and volley to do the data syncronitation. It's one of the first application that I did, for that reason, it doesn't have an architecture and good folder structure.

I decided it to keep it because It's a good way to know how much I've improved myself.
